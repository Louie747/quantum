                                    Hello! I am Aidan Gyle A. Abrogar, the Team Leader of the Quantum Seven. 
                                    I am 19 years old and my course is Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). 
                                    There's a little to add here rather than my hobbies and skills, but that's fine. 
                                    I believe that great things in my life are yet to come, and I'll make it happen as an IT specialist someday. 
                                    The thing I like doing the most is dancing. We usually perform at some events here at OLFU QC under the name of the "Legacy PH".
                                    What I dislike the most is doing nothing. I don't like being unproductive, so I tend to do things a lot just to not waste time. 
                                    I think that's enough for you to have an idea about me. Furthermore, as the Team Leader of the Quantum Seven, you can contact me here for inquiries, and suggestions:

                                    Hi there! I'm Marzel Louis C. Cuadra, a Front End Developer at Quantum Seven. 
                                    At 19 years old, I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology (BSIT). 
                                    When I'm not immersed in the world of web development, you can find me enjoying two of my favorite hobbies. 
                                    I have a real passion for basketball, and I love hitting the court to shoot some hoops. Additionally, I have a thrill-seeking side, 
                                    which I satisfy by riding motorcycles. These hobbies add a lot of excitement to my life, alongside my love for technology and music
                                    Feel free to contact me here for any inquiries or suggestions.

                                    Hello! I'm Russel D. Mirandilla, the backend developer of Quantum Seven. 
                                    I'm 19 years old and pursuing a degree in information technology (BSIT). 
                                    My hobbies include watching some tutorials that I need to learn. Also, to improve my capabilities, 
                                    even in the worst cases of failure as a student, I will do everything to take this opportunity to exceed my limitations. 
                                    Helping each other may be the greatest thing that we receive; it would be the key to survive, 
                                    and we need that until the end of the semester. 
                                    Be humble and strong to be a better person for the future.
